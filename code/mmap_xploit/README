*Highly* recommend you first read this article fully.

Procedure:
1. Build the demo mmap_baddrv driver
make

2. Load up the driver, create the device nodes it requires
Can do this manually in the usual manner (insmod, mknod, ...),
it's just a lot easier with our wrapper script:
sudo ./load_drv.sh -c mmap_baddrv

3. Run the exploit:
./userspc_mmap /dev/mmap_baddrv 1900000000
